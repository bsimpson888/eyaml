# xyaml

xyaml is a extension to the PyYaml package wich supports the inclusion of other yaml files and allows value overwriting.
This is especially useful when dealing with big config files or with multiple config files inheriting common settings.
The mechanism allows you also to deal with default settings which are overwritten by non default values.
